# american-time-usage
For this project, we want to look at the American Time Usage Survey, which tracks how people use/spend their time. We think that specifically looking at the 2020 dataset would allow us to get a better understanding of how the pandemic affected peopleâ€™s time usage (work, leisure, childcare, etc.) from May 2020 and beyond, and then compare this to pre-pandemic levels.
